## Component Descriptions:

1. **Visual Novel Frontend (Ren'Py)**
   - Web-exported Ren'Py game
   - Handles game logic, story progression, and UI
   - Communicates with backend services via API calls

2. **Game Server / API Gateway**
   - Coordinates communication between Ren'Py and services
   - Manages authentication and session state
   - Routes requests to appropriate services

3. **Database Service**
   - Stores player progress, vocabulary lists
   - Tracks learning metrics and achievements
   - Manages game state persistence

4. **OpenVINO Image Generation**
   - Generates background scenes based on story context
   - Creates character images and expressions
   - Optimizes inference for real-time generation

5. **Docker Services**
   - **LLM Text**: Generates dialogue, translations, and explanations for JLPT N5 content
   - **TTS**: Converts Japanese text to spoken audio using XTTS
   - **ASR**: Processes player's spoken Japanese for pronunciation practice
   - **LLM Vision**: Assists with image understanding and generation
   - **Embeddings**: Provides semantic understanding for adaptive learning

## Data Flow:

1. Player interacts with Ren'Py game interface
2. Game requests content (dialogue, translations, audio) from API Gateway
3. API Gateway routes requests to appropriate services
4. Services process requests and return results
5. Game updates UI with received content
6. Player progress is saved to database

## Integration Points:

1. **Ren'Py to API Gateway**: HTTP/REST API calls
2. **API Gateway to Services**: Internal network communication
3. **Services to Database**: Shared volume access
4. **OpenVINO to Game**: Pre-generated or real-time image delivery
