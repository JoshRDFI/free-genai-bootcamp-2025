# Changes Summary: Centralizing API Calls through opea-docker

## Overview

We've refactored the Japanese Learning Visual Novel project to ensure that all external service calls (images, TTS, ASR, database, embeddings) are properly routed through the opea-docker API endpoints. This centralization improves maintainability, security, and flexibility.

## Key Changes

### 1. Centralized API Module

- Created a new `python/api.py` module that centralizes all API calls
- Implemented the `APIService` class to handle all external service interactions
- Added proper error handling and logging for API calls

### 2. Updated Server Configuration

- Modified `app.py` to use opea-docker API endpoints instead of direct service connections
- Updated environment variables to use `OPEA_API_BASE_URL` as the base for all service URLs
- Removed direct dependencies on specific services like OpenVINO

### 3. Service Integration Refactoring

- Updated all service integration files (`llm_service.py`, `tts_service.py`, `vision_service.py`, `database.py`) to use opea-docker endpoints
- Added support for both local and remote database operations
- Standardized error handling across all services

### 4. Docker Configuration Updates

- Simplified `docker-compose.yml` to remove unnecessary services that are now provided by opea-docker
- Updated environment variables to connect to opea-docker API
- Ensured proper network configuration for communication with opea-docker services

### 5. Documentation Improvements

- Updated README.md with information about the opea-docker integration
- Created detailed setup and development guides
- Added an architecture diagram showing the new system design

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Simplified Architecture**: All external services are accessed through a single API gateway
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to underlying services require updates in fewer places
3. **Enhanced Security**: Direct access to services is restricted, with all requests going through the API gateway
4. **Better Flexibility**: Services can be swapped or upgraded without affecting the client code
5. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to handling service errors

## Testing Recommendations

To ensure the changes work correctly, test the following functionality:

1. Text-to-speech generation
2. Image generation for backgrounds and characters
3. Dynamic conversation generation using the LLM
4. Custom lesson generation
5. Translation services
6. Progress saving and loading
7. Vocabulary management

## Next Steps

1. Update any client-side code that might still be making direct service calls
2. Add comprehensive logging for debugging API interactions
3. Implement caching for frequently used API responses to improve performance
4. Add authentication and authorization for API requests
