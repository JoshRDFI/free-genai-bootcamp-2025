INSTRUCTIONS:

Guided Translation:
Help students translate English sentences into Japanese by asking questions and providing hints.
Never provide direct answers or full translations. Focus on guiding the student to think critically.
Assist with:
Sentence construction (e.g., Subject-Object-Verb order).
Particle usage (e.g., は, が, を, に).
Verb/adjective conjugation (e.g., plain/dictionary form first).

Thoughts
Okay, let's tackle this student input. The sentence is "Did you see the ravens in the garden this morning?" The user has specified that I need to follow the exact structure of the previous example. First, I need to create a vocabulary table with English, Japanese in dictionary form, and Romaji. The words to include are "see," "raven," "garden," "morning," and maybe "this." But "this" is a determiner, so maybe not. The example included "to leave" and "to be," so verbs are important.

Next, I need to formulate guiding questions in Japanese characters. For the first part, "Did you see the ravens," I should ask about the verb "to see" in past tense, maybe which particle to use for the object. For "in the garden," particles like で or に might be relevant. "This morning" would require time expression structure. Also, forming a question with か at the end.

Then, a sentence structure hint in Japanese. Need to make sure to use the correct particles and verb conjugation. Let me check the previous example again to match the format.

Wait, the vocabulary table should exclude conjugated verbs and particles. So "see" should be 見る in dictionary form. "Raven" is からす. "Garden" is にわ. "Morning" is あさ. "This" as この. But "this" is a determiner, but maybe include it as it's part of the sentence. However, the instruction says verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs. "This" is a determiner, so maybe exclude. Let me double-check the example. In the example, "To be (exist)" was included as a verb. So verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs. "This" isn't any of those, so exclude. So English words are "see," "raven," "garden," "morning."

Now, the guiding questions. For "Did you see..." start with the verb 見る. Ask about past tense conjugation, maybe. Then particles for the object を. For "ravens," plural isn't marked in Japanese, but maybe ask about the noun. "In the garden" uses で or に. The time phrase "this morning" uses の for possession? Or に for time? Maybe ask about how to structure time in the sentence. Also, question formation with か.

Sentence structure hint: 「[あなたは]今朝庭でからすを見ましたか？」 and mention particles like を for the object, で for location, and か for the question. Maybe break it down into parts.

Check if all components are covered without giving direct answers. Make sure to use only Japanese characters outside the table. Okay, this seems to align with the example provided. Let me put it all together following the structure.

Response:

Step 1: Vocabulary Table
English	Japanese (Dictionary Form)	Romaji
To see	見る	miru
Raven	からす	karasu
Garden	庭	niwa
Morning	朝	asa
Step 2: Guiding Questions (in Japanese characters)
First Clause: "Did you see the ravens..."
「見る」は過去形にどうなりますか？「見ました」？「見た」？
(How do you conjugate "miru" to past tense? "Mimashita" or "mita"?)
「からす」は目的語です。どの助詞を使いますか？「を」？
(The ravens are the object. Which particle do we use? "O"?)
Second Clause: "...in the garden this morning."
「庭」で場所を表すには、助詞は何を使いますか？「で」？「に」？
(Which particle indicates location for "garden"? "De" or "ni"?)
「今朝」は時間を表す言葉はどこに入れますか？文の最初？最後？
(Where do we place "this morning" in the sentence? At the beginning or end?)
Question Structure:
質問文の最後に何をつけますか？「か」？
(What particle do we add at the end to make a question? "Ka"?)
Step 3: Sentence Structure Hint (in Japanese characters)
「[あなたは] [今朝] [庭] で [からす] を [見ました] か？」

ヒント:
「を」→ 目的語 (からす) を示す。
「で」→ 場所 (庭) を示す。
「か」→ 質問を作る。
This guides the student to:

Use 見る → 見ました (past tense).
Place 今朝 (this morning) at the start or before the verb.
Structure: Time (今朝) + Location (庭で) + Object (からすを) + Verb (見ましたか).
